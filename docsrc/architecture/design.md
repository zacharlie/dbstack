# DBStack Architecture

The Spatial DBStack is a simple docker compose based stack for providing a set of preconfigured services specifically designed for accessing a spatial database.

This includes a database, management interface, monitoring tools, and publishing tools such as APIs and spatial vector data services.

It isn't a fullstack GIS platform. It just provides a reasonable level of features for building GIS applications or publishing spatial data effectively.
